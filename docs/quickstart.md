## FSC Identikit Quickstart

To get up and running with Identikit, follow these steps:

>1. Install <https://nodejs.org> on your computer.
>2. Download the [latest version of Identikit](https://github.com/FieldStudiesCouncil/tombiovis/releases). Follow the link and download the latest '**Source code (zip)**'.
>3. Unzip the downloaded zip file ```tombiovis-n.n.n.zip``` to any convenient location on your computer.
>4. Using your usual file explorer tools, open the folder ```tombiovis-n.n.n/tombiovis-n.n.n```.
>5. Open a Windows 'command window' by double-clicking the ```start.bat``` file (non-Windows users see note below).
>6. In the command window, type ```npm install``` and hit enter.
>7. In the command window, type ```npm start``` and hit enter.

Non-Windows users will probably not be able to run the  ```start.bat``` file in step 5. Instead open whatever the equivalent command or terminal window is on your operating system and then continue from step 6.

Step 6 is a one-off step to configure NodeJS for the Identikit. Subsequently, all you have to do to start the Identikit is repeat steps 5 and 7. You must leave the 'command window' open whilst Identikit runs, but you can minimise it if you like.

>If you have an existing a knowledge-base, just move or copy the entire folder into the ```tombiovis-n.n.n/tombiovis-n.n.n/identikit/kb``` folder. 

That's all - no need to edit any HTML files. Links to use your knowledge-base - both with standard and mobile interfaces - will appear when you start Identikit. 

>If you are starting from scratch, just copy and rename the entire ```biscuits``` knowledge-base folder in the aforementioned ```kb``` folder and start modifying the Excel spreadsheet within.
