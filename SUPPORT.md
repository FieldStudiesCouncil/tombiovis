## How to get support

The best way to get support for the Identikit project is to post a message onto
the forum:

- [https://forum.fscbiodiversity.uk/c/identikit](https://github.com/FieldStudiesCouncil/tombiovis/discussions)

This forum is monitored by Identikit creator Rich Burkmar and members of the Field Studies Council biodiversity team, so this is the fastest way to get a response.

If you cannot sign up to the forum, or you wish to send a private message, you can email Rich or Charles directly using the following email addresses:

- c.roper@field-studies-council.org
- rburkmar@ceh.ac.uk
