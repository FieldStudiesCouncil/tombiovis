**The FSC Identikit is an open-source project which anyone is free to get
involved in. It is provided as-is and Field Studies Council is not able to provide any support or development
for it at this time.**

To get started quickly, follow our [Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md).

The FSC Identikit is a framework for creating online biological identification
resources, including multi-access keys.

The genesis of the project was the Field Studies Council's (FSC) Tomorrow's
Biodiversity project (funded by Esmée Fairbairn 2013-2017 inclusive). Esmée
Fairbairn funded a further year's development of the Identikit (covering 2018)
to facilitate rolling the work forward into the HLF-funded FSC BioLinks project
which ran from 2018 to the end of 2022.

_Prior to March 2018, The FSC Identikit was referred to as 'The Tom.bio
ID Visualisation Framework', or variations thereof._

## Try it out

Try the software out:
* With the [standard interface](https://fieldstudiescouncil.github.io/tombiovis/identikit/vis.html).
* With the [mobile interface](https://fieldstudiescouncil.github.io/tombiovis/identikit/vism.html).

## Developers
The repostitory can be cloned thus: ```git clone https://github.com/FieldStudiesCouncil/tombiovis.git```.

If the clone fails, try the following: ```git clone https://github.com/FieldStudiesCouncil/tombiovis.git --depth 1 --no-single-branch```.

The second git command clones the repostiory with a truncated history. This should be fine for most purposes.

## Documentation

All documentation for this project is found in the 'documentation'
sub-folder and includes the following:
